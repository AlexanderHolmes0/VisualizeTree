## Decision Tree Visualization App

Welcome to the Decision Tree Visualization App, a web application that visualizes decision trees! This app is designed to provide an interactive way to understand how decision trees work, and to explore how different decisions and features can affect the final outcome of a decision tree.

## How to use the app 🧑‍💻

To use the app, simply click on the following link: https://aholmes24.shinyapps.io/VisualizeTree/

Once you have launched the app, you can begin to adjust the parameters of the decision tree model, including the minimum number of oberservations required to split an internal node, and the minimum number of improvement in R<super>2</super> or the reduction in Gini coefficient.

Think of 'Gini' as the impurity of the leaf/node/split. 😇

As you make changes to the decision tree model, the app will update the visualization of the tree in real-time.

## About decision trees 🌲

A decision tree is a popular machine learning algorithm that is used for classification and regression tasks. It works by recursively partitioning the data into subsets based on the values of the input features, until a stopping criterion is met (e.g., the tree

## About the app

This app was developed by me, and is designed to help users understand the inner workings of decision trees. It uses the R programming language and the Shiny web application framework to create an interactive user interface for visualizing decision trees.

The app provides a sidebar with some basic information/functionality about decision trees, as well as a brief explanation of the accuracy of the fitted tree. a confusion table is provided to see what the model did with the training and testing data.
